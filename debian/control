Description: Three-dimensional finite element mesh generator
 Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element mesh generator (primarily
 Delaunay) with build-in CAD and post-processing facilities. Its
 design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
 cases with parametric input and up to date visualization
 capabilities.
 .
 Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
 post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is
 done either interactively using the graphical user interface or in
 ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
 .
 See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's
 capabilities.
