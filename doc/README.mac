How to make a version recognized by the Mac Finder?

The old way (using resource forks):

- compile

- append the resources to the executable:

  /Developer/Tools/Rez -t APPL -o bin/gmsh Fltk/MacRes.r

- copy all the stuff you want to distribute (using the finder or
  'ditto'! copying with 'cp' in a shell will destroy the resources!)
  to a distribution folder

- a) use the DiskCopy utility to create a disk image (.dmg)

  b) you can also create the disk image on the command line, using
     utils/misc/makedmg.sh (WARNING: modify the script to suit your needs)

The new way:

- use the new XML-based scheme: see 'make distrib-mac'

- ...and just 'tar zcvf' the directory. No more crappy resources!
