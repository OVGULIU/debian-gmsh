1) Install GNU make and related tools (e.g. from cygwin or mingw)
    
2) launch the Visual Studio command prompt

3) set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin  (or wherever the make tools are installed)

4) go to the gmsh directory and rename "utils/misc/variables.msvc" to "variables"

5) edit "variables" to match your local installation of Visual C++

6) type "make"
