This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities.

Gmsh is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. See the LICENSE and CREDITS files for more information.

The tutorial/ directory contains the examples from the tutorial
chapter in the reference manual (http://geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/).
The demos/ directory contains additional examples.

Important notes:

1) About OPENGL32.DLL and GLU32.DLL:

If your system complains about missing OPENGL32.DLL or GLU32.DLL
libraries, then OpenGL is not properly installed on your machine. You
can download OpenGL from Microsoft's web site, or directly from
http://www.opengl.org.

2) About configuration files:

Gmsh will attempt to save temporary files and persistent configuration
options first in the $GMSH_HOME directory, then in the $HOME, $TMP or
$TEMP directories (in that order) if the $GMSH_HOME environment
variable is not defined. If none of these variables are defined, Gmsh
will try to save/load its configuration files from the current working
directory.

3) About the solver interface:

By default, on Windows, Gmsh communicates with solvers on the TCP/IP
port 44122. You can change this in the Solver option panel.
