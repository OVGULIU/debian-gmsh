Gmsh is ``free software''; this means that everyone is free to use it and
to redistribute it on a free basis. Gmsh is not in the public domain; it is
copyrighted and there are restrictions on its distribution, but these
restrictions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating
citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others
from further sharing any version of Gmsh that they might get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of Gmsh, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want
it, that you can change Gmsh or use pieces of Gmsh in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive
anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies of
Gmsh, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for Gmsh.  If Gmsh is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want their recipients to know that what they have is not
what we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on our reputation.

The precise conditions of the license for Gmsh are found in the General
Public License that accompanies the source code (@pxref{License}). Further
information about this license is available from the GNU Project webpage
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html}.  Detailed copyright
information can be found in @ref{Credits}.

The source code and various pre-compiled versions of Gmsh (for Unix, Windows
and Mac OS) can be downloaded from the webpage @uref{http://geuz.org/gmsh/}.

If you use Gmsh, we would appreciate that you mention it in your
work. References, as well as the latest news about Gmsh development, are
always available on @uref{http://geuz.org/gmsh/}. Please send all
Gmsh-related questions to the public Gmsh mailing list at
@email{gmsh@@geuz.org}.

If you want to integrate Gmsh into a closed-source software, or want to sell
a modified closed-source version of Gmsh, please contact one of the
authors. You can purchase a version of Gmsh under a different license, with
``no strings attached'' (for example allowing you to take parts of Gmsh and
integrate them into your own proprietary code).
