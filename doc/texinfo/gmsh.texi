@cindex Overview

Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator
with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Its design goal is to
provide a simple meshing tool for academic problems with parametric
input and advanced visualization capabilities.

Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
post-processing. All geometrical, mesh, solver and post-processing
instructions are prescribed either interactively using the graphical
user interface (GUI) or in text files using Gmsh's own scripting
language.  Interactive actions generate language bits in the input
files, and vice versa. This makes it possible to automate all
treatments, using loops, conditionals and external system calls. A brief
description of the four modules is given hereafter.

@c Geometry: geometrical entity definition
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Geometry, Mesh, Overview, Overview
@section Geometry: geometrical entity definition

Gmsh uses a boundary representation (``BRep'') to describe geometries.
Models are created in a bottom-up flow by successively defining points,
oriented lines (line segments, circles, ellipses, splines, @dots{}),
oriented surfaces (plane surfaces, ruled surfaces, triangulated
surfaces, @dots{}) and volumes. Compound groups of geometrical entities
(called ``physical groups'') can also be defined, based on these
elementary geometric entities. Gmsh's scripting language allows all
geometrical entities to be fully parametrized.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Mesh: finite element mesh generation
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Mesh, Solver, Geometry, Overview
@section Mesh: finite element mesh generation

A finite element mesh is a tessellation of a given subset of the
three-dimensional space by elementary geometrical elements of various
shapes (in Gmsh's case: lines, triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra,
prisms, hexahedra and pyramids), arranged in such a way that if two of
them intersect, they do so along a face, an edge or a node, and never
otherwise. All the finite element meshes produced by Gmsh are considered
as ``unstructured'', even if they were generated in a ``structured'' way
(e.g., by extrusion). This implies that the elementary geometrical
elements are defined only by an ordered list of their nodes but that no
predefined order relation is assumed between any two elements.

The mesh generation is performed in the same bottom-up flow as the
geometry creation: lines are discretized first; the mesh of the lines is
then used to mesh the surfaces; then the mesh of the surfaces is used to
mesh the volumes. In this process, the mesh of an entity is only
constrained by the mesh of its boundary. For example, in three
dimensions, the triangles discretizing a surface will be forced to be
faces of tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only if the surface is part of
the boundary of a volume; the line elements discretizing a curve will be
forced to be edges of tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only if the curve
is part of the boundary of a surface, itself part of the boundary of a
volume; a single node discretizing a point in the middle of a volume
will be forced to be a vertex of one of the tetrahedra in the final 3D
mesh only if this point is connected to a curve, itself part of the
boundary of a surface, itself part of the boundary of a volume. This
automatically assures the conformity of the mesh when, for example, two
surfaces share a common line. But this also implies that the
discretization of an ``isolated'' (@var{n}-1)-th dimensional entity
inside an @var{n}-th dimensional entity does @emph{not} constrain the
@var{n}-th dimensional mesh---unless it is explicitly told to do so
(@pxref{Miscellaneous mesh commands}).  Every meshing step is
constrained by the characteristic length field, which can be uniform,
specified by characteristic lengths associated with points in the
geometry, or defined by general ``fields'' (a scalar field defined on
another mesh using post-processing view, threshold fields associated
with point or line ``attractors'', etc.).

For each meshing step, all structured mesh directives are executed
first, and serve as additional constraints for the unstructured parts
@footnote{Note that mixing structured volume grids with unstructured
volume grids generated with the default 3D Delaunay algorithm can
result, in certain cases, to non-conform surface meshes on their shared
boundary. If this happens, you may consider using the frontal algorithm
for the unstructured part.}.

@c Solver: external solver interface
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Solver, Post-processing, Mesh, Overview
@section Solver: external solver interface

External solvers can be interfaced with Gmsh through Unix or TCP/IP
sockets, which permits to launch external computations and to collect
and process the results directly from within Gmsh's post-processing
module. The default solver interfaced with Gmsh is GetDP
(@uref{http://www.geuz.org/getdp/}). Examples on how to interface
solvers written in C, C++, Perl and Python are available in the source
distribution (in the @file{utils/solvers/} directory).

@c Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Post-processing, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Solver, Overview
@section Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization

Gmsh can load and manipulate multiple post-processing scalar, vector or
tensor maps along with the geometry and the mesh. Scalar fields are
represented by iso-value lines/surfaces or color maps, while vector
fields are represented by three-dimensional arrows or displacement
maps. Post-processing functions include section computation, offset,
elevation, boundary and component extraction, color map and range
modification, animation, vector graphic output, etc. All the
post-processing options can be accessed either interactively or through
the input script files. Scripting permits to automate all
post-processing operations, as for example to create
animations. User-defined operations can also be performed on
post-processing views through dynamically loadable plugins.

@c What Gmsh is pretty good at...
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node What Gmsh is pretty good at, and what Gmsh is not so good at, Post-processing, Overview
@section What Gmsh is pretty good at @dots{}

Gmsh is a (relatively) small program, and was principally developed ``in
academia, to solve academic problems''@dots{} Nevertheless, over the
years, many people outside universities have found Gmsh useful in their
day-to-day jobs. Here is a tentative list of what Gmsh does best:

@itemize @bullet
@item
quickly describe simple and/or ``repetitive'' geometries, thanks to
user-defined functions, loops, conditionals and includes (see
@ref{User-defined functions}, @ref{Loops and conditionals}, and @ref{General
commands});
@item
parametrize these geometries. Gmsh's scripting language enables all
commands and command arguments to depend on previous calculations (see
@ref{Expressions}, and @ref{Geometry commands});
@item
import complex models in industry-standard formats like STEP or IGES
(when Gmsh is built with OpenCascade support);
@item
generate 1D, 2D and 3D simplicial (i.e., using line segments, triangles
and tetrahedra) finite element meshes (see @ref{Mesh module}, and
@ref{Tutorial});
@item
specify target element sizes accurately. Gmsh provides several
mechanisms to control the size of the elements in the final mesh:
through interpolation from sizes specified at geometry points or using
flexible mesh size fields (@pxref{Mesh commands});
@item
create simple extruded geometries and meshes (see @ref{Geometry commands},
and @ref{Mesh commands});
@item
interact with external solvers. Gmsh provides C, C++, Perl and Python
interfaces, and others can be easily added (@pxref{Solver module});
@item
visualize computational results in a great variety of ways. Gmsh can display
scalar, vector and tensor datasets, and can perform various operations on
the resulting post-processing views (@pxref{Post-processing module});
@item
export plots in many different formats: vector PostScript or encapsulated
PostScript, LaTeX, PNG, JPEG, @dots{} (@pxref{General options list});
@item
generate complex animations (see @ref{General tools}, and @ref{t8.geo});
@item
run on low end machines and/or machines with no graphical
interface. Gmsh can be compiled with or without the GUI, and all
versions can be used either interactively or directly from the command
line (@pxref{Running Gmsh on your system});
@item
configure your preferred options. Gmsh has a large number of
configuration options that can be set interactively using the GUI,
scattered inside command files, changed on the fly in scripts, set in
per-user configuration files, or specified on the command-line (see
@ref{Running Gmsh on your system} and @ref{Options});
@item
and do all the above on various platforms (Windows, Mac and Unix), for
free (@pxref{Copying conditions}), using simple script files and/or a
small but powerful GUI.
@end itemize

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c ... and what Gmsh is not so good at
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node and what Gmsh is not so good at, Bug reports, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Overview
@section @dots{} and what Gmsh is not so good at

Due to its historical background and limited developer manpower, Gmsh has
also some (a lot of?) weaknesses:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the BRep approach for describing geometries can become inconvenient for
complex models;
@item
there is no support for Nurbs and only very limited support for trimmed
surfaces in Gmsh's scripting language (however you can import STEP or
IGES models with such features when Gmsh is built with OpenCascade
support);
@item
Gmsh is not a multi-bloc generator: all meshes produced by Gmsh are
conforming in the sense of finite element meshes;
@item
Gmsh was designed to solve academic ``test cases'', not industrial-size
problems. You may find that Gmsh is too slow for large problems (with
thousands of geometric primitives, or millions of mesh/post-processing
elements).
@end itemize

If you have the skills and some free time, feel free to join the
project! We gladly accept any code contributions (@pxref{Information for
developers}) to remedy the aforementioned (and all other)
shortcomings...

@c How to read this manual?

@node How to read this manual?, Running Gmsh on your system, Overview, Top
@chapter How to read this reference manual?

Gmsh can be used at three levels:

@enumerate
@item
as a stand-alone graphical program, driven by an interactive graphical
user interface (GUI);
@item 
as a stand-alone script-driven program;
@item
as a library.
@end enumerate

You can skip most of this reference manual if you only want to use Gmsh
at the first level (i.e., interactively with the GUI). Just read the
next chapter (@pxref{Running Gmsh on your system}) to learn how to
launch Gmsh on your system, then go experiment with the GUI and the
tutorial files (@pxref{Tutorial}) provided in the distribution.
Screencasts that show how to use the GUI are available here:
@uref{http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/screencasts/}.

The aim of the reference manual is to explain everything you need to use
Gmsh at the second level, i.e., using the built-in scripting language.
A Gmsh script file is an ASCII text file that contains instructions in
Gmsh's built-in scripting language. Such a file is interpreted by Gmsh's
parser, and can be given any extension (or no extension at all). By
convention, Gmsh uses the @file{.geo} extension for geometry scripts,
and the @file{.pos} extension for parsed post-processing datasets. Once
you master the tutorial (read the source files: they are heavily
commented!), start reading chapter @ref{General tools}, then proceed
with the next four chapters, which detail the syntax of the geometry,
mesh, solver and post-processing scripting commands. You will see that
most of the interactive actions in the GUI have a direct equivalent in
the scripting language. If you want to use Gmsh as a pre- or
post-processor for your own software, you will also want to learn about
the non-scripting input/output files that Gmsh can read/write. In
addition to Gmsh's native ``MSH'' file format (@pxref{File formats}),
Gmsh can read/write many standard mesh files, depending on how it was
built: check the `File->Save As' menu for a list of available formats.

Finally, to use Gmsh at the third level (i.e., to link the Gmsh library
with your own code), you will need to learn the internal Gmsh
Application Programming Interface (API). No complete documentation of
this API is available yet; a good starting point is @ref{Source code
structure}, which gives a short introduction to Gmsh's internal source
code structure. Then have a look e.g. at the examples in the
@file{utils/api_demos/} directory in the source code.

@section Interactive mode

@cindex Interactive mode

To launch Gmsh in interactive mode, just double-click on the Gmsh icon,
or type

@example
> gmsh
@end example

@noindent at your shell prompt in a terminal. This will open
two windows: the graphic window (with a status bar at the bottom) and
the menu window (with a menu bar and some context-dependent buttons).

To open the first tutorial file (@pxref{Tutorial}), select the
`File->Open' menu, and choose @file{t1.geo} in the input field. When
using a terminal, you can specify the file name directly on the command
line, i.e.:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo
@end example

To perform the mesh generation, go to the mesh module (by selecting
`Mesh' in the module menu) and choose the dimension in the
context-dependent buttons (`1D' will mesh all the lines; `2D' will mesh
all the surfaces---as well as all the lines if `1D' was not called
before; `3D' will mesh all the volumes---and all the surfaces if `2D'
was not called before). To save the resulting mesh in the current mesh
format click on the `Save' button, or select the appropriate format and
file name with the `File->Save As' menu. The default mesh file name is
based on the name of the current active model, with an appended
extension depending on the mesh format@footnote{Nearly all the
interactive commands have shortcuts: see @ref{Keyboard shortcuts}, or
select `Help->Keyboard Shortcuts' in the menu. For example, to quickly
save a mesh, you can press @kbd{Ctrl+Shift+s}.}.

To create a new geometry or to modify an existing geometry, select
'Geometry' in the module menu, and follow the context-dependent buttons.
For example, to create a spline, select `Elementary', `Add', `New' and
`Spline'. You will then be asked to select a list of points, and to type
@kbd{e} to finish the selection (or @kbd{q} to abort it). Once the
interactive command is completed, a text string is automatically added
at the end of the current script file. You can edit the script file by
hand at any time by pressing the `Edit' button in the `Geometry' menu
and then reloading the model by pressing `Reload'. For example, it is
often faster to define variables and points directly in the script file,
and then use the GUI to define the lines, the surfaces and the volumes
interactively.

Several files can be loaded simultaneously in Gmsh. The first one
defines the active model and the others are `merged' into this
model. You can merge such files with the `File->Merge' menu, or by
directly specifying the names of the files on the command line. For
example, to merge the post-processing views contained in the files
@file{view1.pos} and @file{view5.msh} together with the geometry of the
first tutorial @file{t1.geo}, you can type the following command:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo view1.pos view5.msh
@end example

In the Post-Processing module (select `Post-Processing' in the module
menu), three buttons will appear, respectively labeled `A scalar map',
`Nodal scalar map' and `Element 1 vector'. In this example the views
contain several time steps: you can loop through them with the small
``remote-control'' icons at the bottom of the graphic window. A mouse
click on the view name will toggle the visibility of the selected view,
while a click on the arrow button on the right will provide access to
the view's options.

Note that all the options specified interactively can also be directly
specified in the script files. You can save the current options of the
current active model with the `File->Save Options' menu. This will
create a new option file with the same filename as the active model, but
with an extra @file{.opt} extension added. The next time you open this
model, the associated options will be automatically loaded, too.  To
save the current options as your default preferences for all future Gmsh
sessions, use the `File->Save Default Options' menu instead. Finally,
you can also save the current options in an arbitrary file by choosing
the `Gmsh options' format in `File->Save As'.

Gmsh can be run non-interactively in `batch' mode, without
GUI@footnote{If you compile Gmsh without the GUI, this is the only mode
you have access to.}. For example, to mesh the first tutorial in batch
mode, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2
@end example

To mesh the same example, but with the background mesh available in the file
@file{bgmesh.pos}, type:

@example

This chapter describes the general commands and options that can be used
in Gmsh's script files. By ``general'', we mean ``not specifically
related to one of the geometry, mesh, solver or post-processing
modules''. Commands peculiar to these modules will be introduced in
@ref{Geometry module}, @ref{Mesh module}, @ref{Solver module}, and
@ref{Post-processing module}, respectively.

@node Floating point expressions, Character expressions, Expressions, Expressions
@subsection Floating point expressions

@cindex Expressions, floating point
@cindex Real numbers
@cindex Numbers, real
@cindex Floating point numbers

Floating point expressions (or, more simply, ``expressions'') are denoted by
the metasyntactic variable @var{expression} (remember the definition of the
syntactic rules in @ref{Syntactic rules}), and are evaluated during the
parsing of the script file:

@example
@var{expression}:
  @var{real} |
  @var{string} |
  @var{string} [ @var{expression} ] |
  # @var{string} [ ] |
  ( @var{expression} ) |
  @var{operator-unary-left} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-unary-right} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-left} @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-right} @var{expression} |
  @var{built-in-function} |
  @var{real-option} |
  GetValue("@var{string}", @var{expression})
@end example

Such @w{@var{expression}s} are used in most of Gmsh's scripting
commands.  The third and fourth cases in this definition permit to
extract one item from a list (see below) and get the size of a list,
respectively. The operators @var{operator-unary-left},
@var{operator-unary-right}, @var{operator-binary},
@var{operator-ternary-left} and @var{operator-ternary-right} are defined
in @ref{Operators}. For the definition of @w{@var{built-in-function}s},
see @ref{Built-in functions}. The various @w{@var{real-option}s} are
listed in @ref{Options}.

The last case in the definition allows to ask the user for a value
interactively. For example, inserting @code{GetValue("Value of parameter
alpha?", 5.76)} in an input file will query the user for the value of a
certain parameter alpha, assuming the default value is 5.76. If the
option @code{General.NoPopup} is set (@pxref{General options list}), no
question is asked and the default value is automatically used.

@cindex Expressions, lists

List of expressions are also widely used, and are defined as:

@example
@var{expression-list}:
  @var{expression-list-item} <, @var{expression-list-item}> @dots{}
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-list-item}:
  @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{string} [ ] |
  @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] |
  Point @{ @var{expression} @} |
  @var{transform} |
  @var{extrude}
@c  @var{duplicata} - already implemented: should we explain this?
@end example

The second case in this last definition permits to create a list containing
the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s}, with a
unit incrementation step. The third case also permits to create a list
containing the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s},
but with a positive or negative incrementation step equal to the third
@var{expression}. The fourth case permits to reference an expression list.
The fifth case permits to reference an expression sublist (whose elements
are those corresponding to the indices provided by the
@var{expression-list}). The sixth case permits to retrieve the coordinates
of a given geometry point (@pxref{Points}). The last two cases permit to
retrieve the indices of entities created through geometrical transformations
and extrusions (see @ref{Transformations}, and @ref{Extrusions}).

To see the practical use of such expressions, have a look at the first
couple of examples in @ref{Tutorial}. Note that, in order to lighten the
syntax, you can always omit the braces @code{@{@}} enclosing an
@var{expression-list} if this @var{expression-list} only contains a single
item. Also note that a braced @var{expression-list} can be preceded by a
minus sign in order to change the sign of all the
@w{@var{expression-list-item}s}.

@c .........................................................................
@c Character expressions
@c .........................................................................

@node Character expressions, Color expressions, Floating point expressions, Expressions
@subsection Character expressions

@cindex Expressions, character
@cindex Strings

Character expressions are defined as:

@example
@var{char-expression}:
  "@var{string}" |
  Today |
  StrPrefix ( @var{char-expression} ) |
  StrRelative ( @var{char-expression} ) |
  StrCat ( @var{char-expression} , @var{char-expression} ) |
  Sprintf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} ) |
  Sprintf ( @var{char-expression} )
  Sprintf ( @var{char-option} )
@end example

@noindent The third and fourth cases in this definition permit to take the
prefix (e.g. to remove the extension) or the relative path of a string. The
fifth case permits to concatenate two character expressions, and the sixth
and seventh are equivalent to the @code{sprintf} C function (where
@var{char-expression} is a format string that can contain floating point
formatting characters: @code{%e}, @code{%g}, etc.). The last case permits to
use the value of a @var{char-option} as a @var{char-expression}.  The
various @w{@var{char-option}s} are listed in @ref{Options}.

Character expressions are mostly used to specify non-numeric options and
input/output file names. See @ref{t8.geo}, for an interesting usage of
@w{@var{char-expression}s} in an animation script. 

@c .........................................................................
@c Color expressions
@c .........................................................................

@node Color expressions,  , Character expressions, Expressions
@subsection Color expressions

@cindex Expressions, color
@cindex Colors

Colors expressions are hybrids between fixed-length braced
@w{@var{expression-list}s} and @w{@var{string}s}:

@example
@var{color-expression}:
  @var{string} |
  @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @} |
  @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @} |
  @var{color-option}
@end example

@noindent The first case permits to use the X Windows names to refer to colors,
e.g., @code{Red}, @code{SpringGreen}, @code{LavenderBlush3}, @dots{}
(see @file{Common/Colors.h} in the source code for a complete list). The
second case permits to define colors by using three expressions to
specify their red, green and blue components (with values comprised
between 0 and 255). The third case permits to define colors by using
their red, green and blue color components as well as their alpha
channel. The last case permits to use the value of a @var{color-option}
as a @var{color-expression}. The various @w{@var{color-option}s} are
listed in @ref{Options}.

See @ref{t3.geo}, for an example of the use of color expressions.

@end ftable

See @ref{t5.geo}, for an example of a user-defined function. A

@item For @var{string} In @{ @var{expression} : @var{expression} @}
Iterates from the value of the first @var{expression} to the value of the
second @var{expression}, with a unit incrementation step. At each iteration,
the value of the iterate is affected to an expression named @var{string},
and the commands comprised between `@code{For @var{string} In @{

executed.

@item For @var{string} In @{ @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} @}
Iterates from the value of the first @var{expression} to the value of the
second @var{expression}, with a positive or negative incrementation step
equal to the third @var{expression}. At each iteration, the value of the
iterate is affected to an expression named @var{string}, and the commands
comprised between `@code{For @var{string} In @{ @var{expression} :

The following commands can be used anywhere in a Gmsh script:

@ftable @code

@item @var{string} = @var{expression};
Creates a new expression identifier @var{string}, or affects
@var{expression} to an existing expression identifier. Thirteen expression
identifiers are predefined (hardcoded in Gmsh's parser):

@ftable @code
@item Pi
Returns 3.1415926535897932.

@item GMSH_MAJOR_VERSION
Returns Gmsh's major version number.

@item GMSH_MINOR_VERSION
Returns Gmsh's minor version number.

@item GMSH_PATCH_VERSION
Returns Gmsh's patch version number.

@item MPI_Size
Returns the number of processors on which Gmsh is running (always 1, except
if you compiled Gmsh's parallel extensions).

@item MPI_Rank
Returns the rank of the current processor.

@item newp
Returns the next available point number. As explained in @ref{Geometry
module}, a unique number must be associated with every geometrical point:
@code{newp} permits to know the highest number already attributed (plus
one). This is mostly useful when writing user-defined functions
(@pxref{User-defined functions}) or general geometric primitives, when one
does not know @emph{a priori} which numbers are already attributed, and
which ones are still available.

@item newl
Returns the next available line number.

@item news
Returns the next available surface number.

@item newv
Returns the next available volume number.

@item newll
Returns the next available line loop number.

@item newsl
Returns the next available surface loop number.

@item newreg
Returns the next available region number. That is, @code{newreg} returns
the maximum of @code{newp}, @code{newl}, @code{news}, @code{newv},
@code{newll}, @code{newsl} and all physical entity numbers@footnote{For
compatibility purposes, the behavior of @code{newl}, @code{news},
@code{newv} and @code{newreg} can be modified with the
@code{Geometry.OldNewReg} option (@pxref{Geometry options list}).}.
@end ftable

@item @var{string} [ ] = @{ @};
Creates a new expression list identifier @code{@var{string}[]} with an
empty list.

@item @var{string} [ ] = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Creates a new expression list identifier @code{@var{string}[]} with the
list @var{expression-list}, or affects @var{expression-list} to an
existing expression list identifier. (Remember the remark we made when
we defined @w{@var{expression-list}s}: the braces enclosing an
@var{expression-list} are optional if the list only contains a single
item.)

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Affects each item in the right hand side @var{expression-list} to the
elements (indexed by the left hand side @var{expression-list}) of an
existing expression list identifier. The two @w{@var{expression-list}s} must
contain the same number of items. 

@item @var{real-option} = @var{expression};
Affects @var{expression} to a real option.

@item @var{char-option} = @var{char-expression};
Affects @var{char-expression} to a character option.

@item @var{color-option} = @var{color-expression};
Affects @var{color-expression} to a color option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} += @var{expression};
Adds and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier or to
a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} -= @var{expression};
Subtracts and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} *= @var{expression};
Multiplies and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} /= @var{expression};
Divides and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} [ ] += @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Appends @var{expression-list} to an existing expression list or creates
a new expression list with @var{expression-list}).

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] += @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Adds and affects, item per item, the right hand side @var{expression-list}
to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] -= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Subtracts and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] *= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Multiplies and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] /= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Divides and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item Exit;
Aborts the current script.

@item Printf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} );
Prints a character expression in the information window and/or on the
terminal. @code{Printf} is equivalent to the @code{printf} C function:
@var{char-expression} is a format string that can contain formatting
characters (@code{%f}, @code{%e}, etc.). Note that all @w{@var{expression}s}
are evaluated as floating point values in Gmsh (@pxref{Expressions}), so
that only valid floating point formatting characters make sense in

@code{Printf}.

@item Printf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} ) > @var{char-expression};
Same as @code{Printf} above, but output the expression in a file.

@item Printf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} ) >> @var{char-expression};
Same as @code{Printf} above, but appends the expression at the end of
the file.

@item Merge @var{char-expression};
Merges a file named @var{char-expression}. This command is equivalent to
the `File->Merge' menu in the GUI. If the path in @var{char-expression}
is not absolute, @var{char-expression} is appended to the path of the
current file.

@item Draw;
Redraws the scene.

@item BoundingBox;
Recomputes the bounding box of the scene (which is normally computed only
after new geometrical entities are added or after files are included or
merged). The bounding box is computed as follows:
@enumerate
@item
If there is a mesh (i.e., at least one mesh vertex), the bounding
box is taken as the box enclosing all the mesh vertices;
@item
If there is no mesh but there is a geometry (i.e., at least one geometrical
point), the bounding box is taken as the box enclosing all the geometrical
points;
@item
If there is no mesh and no geometry, but there are some post-processing
views, the bounding box is taken as the box enclosing all the primitives in
the views.
@end enumerate

@item BoundingBox @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @};
Forces the bounding box of the scene to the given @w{@var{expression}s} (X
min, X max, Y min, Y max, Z min, Z max).

@item Delete Model;
Deletes the current model (all geometrical entities and their associated
meshes).

@item Delete Physicals;
Deletes all physical groups.

@item Delete Variables;
Deletes all the expressions.

@item Delete @var{string};
Deletes the expression @var{string}.

@item Mesh @var{expression};
Generate @var{expression}-D mesh.

@item Print @var{char-expression};
Prints the graphic window in a file named @var{char-expression}, using
the current @code{Print.Format} (@pxref{General options list}). If the
path in @var{char-expression} is not absolute, @var{char-expression} is
appended to the path of the current file.

@item Sleep @var{expression};
Suspends the execution of Gmsh during @var{expression} seconds.

@item System @var{char-expression};
Executes a system call.

@item SyncModel;
Forces an immediate transfer from the old geometrical database into the
new one (this transfer normally occurs right after a file is read).

@item Include @var{char-expression};
Includes the file named @var{char-expression} at the current position in the
input file. The include command should be given on a line of its own.  If
the path in @var{char-expression} is not absolute, @var{char-expression} is
appended to the path of the current file.

@chapter Geometry module

@cindex Geometry, module
@cindex Module, geometry

Gmsh's geometry module provides a simple CAD engine, using a boundary
representation (``BRep'') approach: you need to first define points
(using the @code{Point} command: see below), then lines (using
@code{Line}, @code{Circle}, @code{Spline}, @dots{}, commands or by
extruding points), then surfaces (using for example the @code{Plane
Surface} or @code{Ruled Surface} commands, or by extruding lines), and
finally volumes (using the @code{Volume} command or by extruding
surfaces).

These geometrical entities are called ``elementary'' in Gmsh's jargon, and
are assigned identification numbers when they are created:

@enumerate
@item each elementary point must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary line must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary surface must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary volume must possess a unique identification number.
@end enumerate

@noindent Elementary geometrical entities can then be manipulated in various
ways, for example using the @code{Translate}, @code{Rotate},
@code{Scale} or @code{Symmetry} commands. They can be deleted with the
@code{Delete} command, provided that no higher-dimension entity
references them.

Compound groups of elementary geometrical entities can also be defined and
are called ``physical'' entities. These physical entities cannot be modified
by geometry commands: their only purpose is to assemble elementary entities
into larger groups, possibly modifying their orientation, so that they can
be referred to by the mesh module as single entities. As is the case with
elementary entities, each physical point, physical line, physical surface or
physical volume must be assigned a unique identification number. See
@ref{Mesh module}, for more information about how physical entities affect
the way meshes are saved.

points.

@item Line Loop ( @var{expression} ) = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Creates an oriented line loop. The @var{expression} inside the parentheses
is the line loop's identification number; the @var{expression-list} on the
right hand side should contain the identification numbers of all the
elementary lines that constitute the line loop. A line loop must be a closed
loop, and the elementary lines should be ordered and oriented (using
negative identification numbers to specify reverse orientation). If the
orientation is correct, but the ordering is wrong, Gmsh will actually
reorder the list internally to create a consistent loop. Although Gmsh
supports it, it is not recommended to specify multiple line loops (or
subloops) in a single @code{Line Loop} command. (Line loops are used to
create surfaces: see @ref{Surfaces}.)

@item Physical Line ( @var{expression} | @var{char-expression} ) = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Creates a physical line. The @var{expression} inside the parentheses is
the physical line's identification number (if a @var{char-expression} is
given instead, a unique identification number is automatically
created); the @var{expression-list} on the right hand side should
contain the identification numbers of all the elementary lines that need
to be grouped inside the physical line. Specifying negative
identification numbers in the @var{expression-list} will reverse the
orientation of the mesh elements belonging to the corresponding
elementary lines in the saved mesh.

Creates a plane surface. The @var{expression} inside the parentheses is the

right hand side should contain the identification numbers of all the line
loops defining the surface. The first line loop defines the exterior
boundary of the surface; all other line loops define holes in the surface.
A line loop defining a hole should not have any lines in common with the
exterior line loop (in which case it is not a hole, and the two surfaces
should be defined separately). Likewise, a line loop defining a hole should
not have any lines in common with another line loop defining a hole in the
same surface (in which case the two line loops should be combined).

@item Ruled Surface ( @var{expression} ) = @{ @var{expression-list} @} < In Sphere @{ @var{expression} @} >;
Creates a ruled surface, i.e., a surface that can be interpolated using
transfinite interpolation. The @var{expression} inside the parentheses
is the ruled surface's identification number; the first
@var{expression-list} on the right hand side should the identification
number of a line loop composed of either three or four elementary
lines. The optional @code{In Sphere} argument forces the surface to be a
spherical patch (the extra parameter gives the identification number of
the center of the sphere).

@item Surface Loop ( @var{expression} ) = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Creates a surface loop (a shell). The @var{expression} inside the
parentheses is the surface loop's identification number; the

is automatically created); the @var{expression-list} on the right hand
side should contain the identification numbers of all the elementary

Extrudes all elementary entities (points, lines or surfaces) in
@var{extrude-list} using a rotation. The first @var{expression-list}
should contain three @w{@var{expression}s} giving the X, Y and Z
direction of the rotation axis; the second @var{expression-list} should
contain three @w{@var{expression}s} giving the X, Y and Z components of
any point on this axis; the last @var{expression} should contain the
rotation angle (in radians).

@item Extrude @{ @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @var{expression} @} @{ @var{extrude-list} @}
Extrudes all elementary entities (points, lines or surfaces) in

first @var{expression-list} should contain three @w{@var{expression}s}
giving the X, Y and Z components of the translation vector; the second
@var{expression-list} should contain three @w{@var{expression}s} giving
the X, Y and Z direction of the rotation axis; the third
@var{expression-list} should contain three @w{@var{expression}s} giving

As explained in @ref{Floating point expressions}, @var{extrude} can be
used in an expression, in which case it returns a list of identification
numbers. By default, the list contains the ``top'' of the extruded
entity at index 0 and the extruded entity at index 1, followed by the
``sides'' of the extruded entity at indices 2, 3, etc.  For example:

@example
  Point(1) = @{0,0,0@};
  Point(2) = @{1,0,0@};
  Line(1) = @{1, 2@};
  out[] = Extrude@{0,1,0@}@{ Line@{1@}; @};
  Printf("top line = %g", out[0]);
  Printf("surface = %g", out[1]);
  Printf("side lines = %g and %g", out[2], out[3]);

All meshes can be subdivided to generate fully quadrangular or fully

@section Choosing the right unstructured algorithm

Gmsh currently provides a choice between three 2D unstructured
algorithms and between two 3D unstructured algorithms. Each algorithm
has its own advantages and disadvantages.

For all 2D unstructured algorithms a Delaunay mesh that contains all the
points of the 1D mesh is initially constructed using a
divide-and-conquer algorithm@footnote{R. A. Dwyer, @emph{A simple
divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing Delaunay triangulations in
O(n log n) expected time}, In Proceedings of the second annual symposium
on computational geometry, Yorktown Heights, 2--4 June 1986.}. Missing
edges are recovered using edge swaps@footnote{N. P. Weatherill,
@emph{The integrity of geometrical boundaries in the two-dimensional
Delaunay triangulation}, Commun. Appl. Numer. Methods 6(2),
pp. 101--109, 1990.}. After this initial step three different algorithms
can be applied to generate the final mesh:

@enumerate
@item 
The ``MeshAdapt'' algorithm@footnote{C. Geuzaine and J.-F. Remacle,
@emph{Gmsh: a three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with
built-in pre- and post-processing facilities}, International Journal for
Numerical Methods in Engineering, Accepted for publication, 2009.} is
based on local mesh modifications. This technique makes use of edge
swaps, splits, and collapses: long edges are split, short edges are
collapsed, and edges are swapped if a better geometrical configuration
is obtained.
@item
The ``Delaunay'' algorithm is inspired by the work of the GAMMA team at
INRIA@footnote{P.-L. George and P. Frey, @emph{Mesh generation}, Hermes,
Lyon, 2000.}. New points are inserted sequentially at the circumcenter
of the element that has the largest adimensional circumradius. The mesh
is then reconnected using an anisotropic Delaunay criterion.
@item
The ``Frontal'' algorithm is inspired by the work of
S. Rebay@footnote{S. Rebay, @emph{Efficient unstructured mesh generation
by means of Delaunay triangulation and Bowyer-Watson algorithm},
J. Comput.  Phys. 106, pp. 25--138, 1993.}.
@end enumerate

These algorithms can be ranked as follows:

For very complex curved surfaces the ``MeshAdapt'' algorithm is the best
choice. When high element quality is important, the ``Frontal''
algorithm should be tried. For very large meshes of plane surfaces the
``Delaunay'' algorithm is the fastest.

In 3D two unstructured algorithms are available:

@enumerate
@item 
The ``Delaunay'' algorithm is split into two separate steps. First, an
initial mesh of the union of all the volumes in the model is performed
using H. Si's Tetgen algorithm@footnote{H. Si, @emph{Tetgen: a quality
tetrahedral mesh generator and three-dimensional Delaunay triangulator},
2004.}. Then a three-dimensional version of the 2D Delaunay algorithm
described above is applied.
@item
The ``Frontal'' algorithm uses J. Schoeberl's Netgen algorithm
@footnote{J. Schoeberl, @emph{Netgen, an advancing front 2d/3d-mesh
generator based on abstract rules}, Comput. Visual. Sci., 1, pp. 41--52,
1997.}.
@end enumerate

The ``Delaunay'' algorithm is the most robust and the fastest, and is
the only one that supports the @code{Field} mechanism to specify element
sizes (@pxref{Characteristic lengths}). However, this algorithm will
sometimes modify the surface mesh, and is thus not suitable for
producing hybrid structured/unstructured grids. In that case the
``Frontal'' algorithm should be preferred. The quality of the elements
produced by both algorithms is comparable. If element quality is
important the mesh optimizer(s) should be applied.

@section Elementary vs. physical entities

If only elementary geometrical entities are defined (or if the
@code{Mesh.SaveAll} option is set; see @ref{Mesh options list}), the
grid produced by the mesh module will be saved ``as is''. That is, all
the elements in the grid will be saved using the identification number
of the elementary entities they discretize as their elementary region
number (and 0 as their physical region number@footnote{This behaviour
was introduced in Gmsh 2.0. In older versions, both the elementary and
the physical region numbers would be set to the identification number of
the elementary region.}; @ref{File formats}). This can sometimes be
inconvenient:

@itemize @bullet
@item
mesh elements cannot be duplicated;
@item 
the orientation of the mesh elements (the ordering of their nodes) is
determined entirely by the orientation of their ``parent'' elementary
entities, and cannot be modified;
@item
elements belonging to different elementary entities cannot be linked as
being part of a larger group having a physical or mathematical meaning (like
`Left wing', `Metallic part', `Dirichlet boundary condition', @dots{}).
@end itemize

To remedy these problems, the geometry module (@pxref{Geometry module})
introduces the notion of ``physical'' entities (also called ``physical
groups''). The purpose of physical entities is to assemble elementary
entities into larger, possibly overlapping groups, and to control the
orientation of the elements in these groups. The introduction of
physical entities in large models usually greatly facilitates the
manipulation of the model (e.g., using `Tools->Visibility' in the GUI)
and the interfacing with external solvers.  

In the MSH file format (@pxref{File formats}), if physical entities are
defined, the output mesh only contains those elements that belong to
physical entities. Other file formats each treat physical entities in
slightly different ways, depending on their capability to define groups.

In all cases, Gmsh reindexes the mesh vertices and elements so that they
are numbered in a continuous sequence in the output files. Note that the
numbers displayed on screen after mesh generation thus usually differ
from the ones saved in the mesh files. To check the actual numbers saved
in the output file just load the file back using `File->Open'.

The mesh module commands mostly permit to modify the characteristic
lengths and specify structured grid parameters. The actual mesh
``actions'' (i.e., ``mesh the lines'', ``mesh the surfaces'' and ``mesh
the volumes'') cannot be specified in the script files. They have to be
given either in the GUI or on the command line (see @ref{Running Gmsh on
your system}, and @ref{Command-line options}).

@subsection Characteristic lengths

@cindex Characteristic lengths
@cindex Mesh, element size
@cindex Size, elements
@cindex Mesh, background
@cindex Background mesh

There are three ways to specify the size of the mesh elements for a
given geometry:

@enumerate
@item
First, if @code{Mesh.CharacteristicLengthFromPoints} is set (it is by
default), you can simply specify characteristic lengths at the
geometrical points of the model (with the @code{Point} command: see
@ref{Points}). The size of the mesh elements will then be computed by
linearly interpolating these characteristic lengths on the initial mesh
(see @ref{Mesh}). This might sometimes lead to over-refinement in some
areas, so that you may have to add ``dummy'' geometrical entities in the
model in order to get the desired element sizes.

This method works with all the algorithms implemented in the mesh
module. The final element sizes are of course constrained by the structured
algorithms for which the element sizes are explicitly specified (e.g.,
transfinite and extruded grids: see @ref{Structured grids}).
@item
Second, if @code{Mesh.CharacteristicLengthFromCurvature} is set (it is
not by default), the mesh will be adapted with respect to the curvature
of the geometrical entities.
@item
Finally, you can specify general characteristic lengths using mesh size
``fields''. Various fields exist:
@itemize @bullet
@item 
A @code{PostView} field specifies an explicit background mesh in the
form of a scalar post-processing view (see @ref{Post-processing
commands}, and @ref{File formats}) in which the nodal values are the
target element sizes.  This method is very general but it requires a
first (usually rough) mesh and a way to compute the target sizes on this
mesh (usually through an error estimation procedure, in an iterative
process of mesh adaptation).

(Note that you can also load a background mesh directly from the command
line using the @code{-bgm} option (@pxref{Command-line options}), or in
the GUI by selecting `Apply as background mesh' in the post-processing
view option menu.)
@item 
A @code{Box} field specifies the size of the elements inside and outside
of a parallelipipedic region.
@item 
A @code{Threshold} field specifies the size of the mesh according to the
distance to some geometrical entities. These entities can for example be
geometry points and lines specified by an @code{Attractor} field.
@item 
A @code{MathEval} field specifies the size of the mesh using an explicit
mathematical function.
@item 
A @code{Min} field specifies the size as the minimum of the sizes
computed using other fields
@item 
@dots{}
@end itemize

Fields are supported by all the algorithms except those based on
Netgen. The list of available fields with their options is given below.
@end enumerate

The three aforementioned methods can be used simultaneously, in which
case the smallest element size is selected at any given point. 

All element sizes are further constrained by the
@code{Mesh.CharacteristicLengthMin}, @code{Mesh.CharacteristicLengthMax}
and @code{Mesh.CharacteristicLengthFactor} options (@pxref{Mesh options
list})

Here are the mesh commands that are related to the specification of
characteristic lengths:

@ftable @code
@item Characteristic Length @{ @var{expression-list} @} = @var{expression};
Modify the characteristic length of the points whose identification
numbers are listed in @var{expression-list}. The new value is given by
@var{expression}.
@item Field[@var{expression}] = @var{string};
Create a new field (with id number @var{expression}), of type
@var{string}.
@item Field[@var{expression}].@var{string} = @var{char-expression} | @var{expression} | @var{expression-list};
Set the option @var{string} of the @var{expression}-th field.
@item Background Field = @var{expression};
Select the @var{expression}-th field as the one used to compute element
sizes. Only one background field can be given; if you want to combine
several field, use the @code{Min} or @code{Max} field (see below).
@end ftable

@ftable @code
@item Extrude @{ @var{expression-list} @} @{ @var{extrude-list} @var{layers} @}
Extrudes both the geometry and the mesh using a translation
(@pxref{Extrusions}). The @var{layers} option determines how the mesh is
extruded and has the following syntax:

@example
@var{layers}:
@group
  Layers @{ @var{expression} @} | 
  Layers @{ @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @{ @var{expression-list} @} @} | 
  Recombine; @dots{}
@end group
@end example

In the first @code{Layers} form, @var{expression} gives the number of
elements to be created in the (single) layer. In the second form, the
first @var{expression-list} defines how many elements should be created
in each extruded layer, and the second @var{expression-list} gives the
normalized height of each layer (the list should contain a sequence of
@var{n} numbers 0 < @var{h1} < @var{h2} < @dots{} < @var{hn} <= 1). See
@ref{t3.geo}, for an example.

For line extrusions, the @code{Recombine} option will recombine triangles
into quadrangles when possible.  For surface extrusions, the
@code{Recombine} option will recombine tetrahedra into prisms, hexahedra or
pyramids.

Please note that, starting with Gmsh 2.0, region numbers cannot be
specified explicitly anymore in @code{Layers} commands. Instead, as with
all other geometry commands, you must use the automatically created
entity identifier created by the extrusion command. For example, the
following extrusion command will return the id of the new ``top''
surface in @code{num[0]} and the id of the new volume in @code{num[1]}:
@example
num[] = Extrude @{0,0,1@} @{ Surface@{1@}; Layers@{10@}; @};
@end example

@item Extrude @{ @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @var{expression} @} @{ @var{extrude-list} @var{layers} @}
Extrudes both the geometry and the mesh using a rotation
(@pxref{Extrusions}). The @var{layers} option is defined as above.

@item Extrude @{ @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @var{expression} @} @{ @var{extrude-list} @var{layers} @}
Extrudes both the geometry and the mesh using a combined translation and
rotation (@pxref{Extrusions}). The @var{layers} option is defined as
above.

@item Extrude @{ Surface @{ @var{expression-list} @}; @var{layers} @}
Extrudes a boundary layer along the normals of the specified surfaces.

@item Transfinite Line @{ @var{expression-list} @} | "*" = @var{expression} < Using Progression | Bump @var{expression} >;
Selects the lines in @var{expression-list} to be meshed with the 1D
transfinite algorithm. The @var{expression} on the right hand side gives the
number of nodes that will be created on the line (this overrides any
characteristic length prescription---see @ref{Characteristic lengths}). The
optional argument `@code{Using Progression @var{expression}}' instructs the
transfinite algorithm to distribute the nodes following a geometric
progression (@code{Progression 2} meaning for example that each line element
in the series will be twice as long as the preceding one). The optional
argument `@code{Using Bump @var{expression}}' instructs the transfinite
algorithm to distribute the nodes with a refinement at both ends of the
line.

@item Transfinite Surface @{ @var{expression-list} @} | "*" < = @{ @var{expression-list} @} > < Left | Right | Alternate > ;
Selects surfaces to be meshed with the 2D transfinite algorithm. The
@var{expression-list} on the right-hand-side should contain the
identification numbers of three or four points on the boundary of the
surface that define the corners of the transfinite interpolation. If no
identification numbers are given, the transfinite algorithm will try to
find the corners automatically. The optional argument specifies the way
the triangles are oriented when the mesh is not recombined.

@item Transfinite Volume @{ @var{expression-list} @} | "*" < = @{ @var{expression-list} @} > ;
Selects five- or six-face volumes to be meshed with the 3D transfinite
algorithm.  The @var{expression-list} on the right-hand-side should
contain the identification numbers of the six or eight points on the
boundary of the volume that define the corners of the transfinite
interpolation. If no identification numbers are given, the transfinite
algorithm will try to find the corners automatically.

Five external solvers can be interfaced simultaneously with Gmsh.

If you just want to start a solver from the solver module, with no
further interactions between the solver and Gmsh, just edit the options
relative to one of the five available solvers (e.g.,
@code{Solver.Name0}, @code{Solver.Executable0}, @dots{}; see @ref{Solver
options list}), and set the corresponding ``client-server'' option to
zero (e.g., @code{Solver.ClientServer0 = 0}). This doesn't require any
modification to be made to the solver.

If you want the solver to interact with Gmsh (for error messages, option
definitions, post-processing, etc.), you need to include
@file{GmshSocket.h} in your code and add the appropriate function calls
inside your program. You can then proceed as in the previous case, but
this time you should set the client-server option to 1 (e.g.,
@code{Solver.ClientServer0 = 1}), so that Gmsh and the solver can
communicate through a Unix socket. See @ref{Solver example}, for an
example of how to interface a C++ solver. Bindings for solvers written
in other languages (C, Perl and Python) are available in the source
distribution.

Gmsh's post-processing module can handle multiple scalar, vector or
tensor datasets along with the geometry and the mesh. The datasets can
be given in several formats: in human-readable ``parsed'' format (these
are just part of a standard input script, but are usually put in
separate files with a @file{.pos} extension), in native MSH files (ASCII
or binary files with @file{.msh} extensions: see @ref{File formats}), or
in standard third-party formats (like MED:
@uref{http://www.code-aster.org/outils/med/}).

Once loaded into Gmsh, scalar fields can be displayed as iso-value lines
and surfaces or color maps, whereas vector fields can be represented
either by three-dimensional arrows or by displacement maps. (Tensor
fields are currently displayed as Von-Mises effective stresses. To
display other (combinations of) components, use @code{Plugin(Extract)}:
see @ref{Post-processing plugins}.)

In Gmsh's jargon, each dataset is called a ``view''. Each view is given
a name, and can be manipulated either individually (each view has its
own button in the GUI and can be referred to by its index in a script)
or globally (see the @code{PostProcessing.Link} option in
@ref{Post-processing options list}).

By default, Gmsh treats all post-processing views as three-dimensional
plots, i.e., draws the scalar, vector and tensor primitives (points, lines,
triangles, tetrahedra, etc.) in 3D space. But Gmsh can also represent each
post-processing view containing @emph{scalar points} as two-dimensional
(``X-Y'') plots, either space- or time-oriented:

@itemize @bullet
@item
in a `2D space' plot, the scalar points are taken in the same order as they
are defined in the post-processing view: the abscissa of the 2D graph is
the curvilinear abscissa of the curve defined by the point series, and only
one curve is drawn using the values associated with the points. If several
time steps are available, each time step generates a new curve;
@item
in a `2D time' plot, one curve is drawn for each scalar point in the view
and the abscissa is the time step.
@end itemize

Although visualization is usually mostly an interactive task, Gmsh exposes
all the post-processing commands and options to the user in its scripting
language to permit a complete automation of the post-processing process (see
e.g., @ref{t8.geo}, and @ref{t9.geo}).

The two following sections summarize all available post-processing commands
and options. Most options apply to both 2D and 3D plots (colormaps,
point/line sizes, interval types, time step selection, etc.), but some are
peculiar to 3D (lightning, element selection, etc.) or 2D plots (abscissa
labels, etc.). Note that 2D plots can be positioned explicitly inside the
graphical window, or be automatically positioned in order to avoid overlaps.

Sample post-processing files in human-readable ``parsed'' format and in
the native MSH file format are available in the @file{tutorial}
directory of Gmsh's distribution (@file{.pos} and @file{.msh}
files). The ``parsed'' format is defined in the next section (cf. the
@code{View} command); the MSH format is defined in @ref{File formats}.

Creates an alias of the @var{expression}-th post-processing view. 

Note that @code{Alias} creates a logical duplicate of the view without
actually duplicating the data in memory. This is very useful when you want
multiple simultaneous renderings of the same large dataset (usually with
different display options), but you cannot afford to store all copies in

all the options of the @var{expression}-th view to the new aliased view.

@item Combine ElementsByViewName;
Combines all the post-processing views having the same name into new views.
The combination is done ``spatially'', i.e., simply by appending the
elements at the end of the new views.

@item Combine ElementsFromAllViews | Combine Views;
Combines all the post-processing views into a single new view.  The
combination is done ``spatially'', i.e., simply by appending the elements at

@item Combine ElementsFromVisibleViews;
Combines all the visible post-processing views into a single new view. The

@item Combine TimeStepsByViewName | Combine TimeSteps;
Combines the data from all the post-processing views having the same name

i.e., as if the data in each view corresponds to a different time
instant. The combination will fail if the meshes in all the views are not
identical.

@item Combine TimeStepsFromAllViews;
Combines the data from all the post-processing views into a new
multi-time-step view. The combination is done ``temporally'', i.e., as if
the data in each view corresponds to a different time instant. The
combination will fail if the meshes in all the views are not identical.

@item Combine TimeStepsFromVisibleViews;
Combines the data from all the visible post-processing views into a new

combination will fail if the meshes in all the views are not identical.

@item Plugin (@var{string}) . @var{string} = @var{expression} | @var{char-expression};
Sets an option for a given plugin. See @ref{Post-processing plugins}, for a
list of default plugins and @ref{t9.geo}, for some examples.

@item Save View[@var{expression}] @var{char-expression};
Saves the the @var{expression}-th post-processing view in a file named
@var{char-expression}. If the path in @var{char-expression} is not absolute,
@var{char-expression} is appended to the path of the current file.

@item View "@var{string}" @{ @var{string} < ( @var{expression-list} ) > @{ @var{expression-list} @}; @dots{} @};
Creates a new post-processing view, named @code{"@var{string}"}.  This
is an easy and quite powerful way to import post-processing data: all
the values are @var{expressions}, you can embed datasets directly into
your geometrical descriptions (see, e.g., @ref{t4.geo}), the data can be
easily generated ``on-the-fly'' (there is no header containing @emph{a
priori} information on the size of the dataset). The syntax is also very
permissive, which makes it ideal for testing purposes.

However this ``parsed format'' is read by Gmsh's script parser, which
makes it inefficient if there are many elements in the dataset. Also,
there is no connectivity information in parsed views and all the
elements are independent (all fields can be discontinuous), so a lot of
information can be duplicated. For large datasets, you should thus use
the mesh-based post-processing file format described in @ref{File
formats}, or use one of the standard formats like MED.

More explicitly, the syntax for a parsed @code{View} is the following

@example
@group
View "@var{string}" @{
  @var{type} ( @var{list-of-coords} ) @{ @var{list-of-values} @}; @dots{}
  < TIME @{ @var{expression-list} @}; >

@};

The coordinates are given `by node', i.e.,

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{(@var{coord1}, @var{coord2}, @var{coord3})} for a point,
@item 
@code{(@var{coord1-node1}, @var{coord2-node1}, @var{coord3-node1},}@* 
@code{ @var{coord1-node2}, @var{coord2-node2}, @var{coord3-node2})} for a line,

@code{ @var{coord1-node3}, @var{coord2-node3}, @var{coord3-node3})} for a triangle,
@item
etc.
@end itemize

The ordering of the nodes is given in @ref{Node ordering}.

The values are given by time step, by node and by component, i.e.:
@example
@var{comp1-node1-time1}, @var{comp2-node1-time1}, @var{comp3-node1-time1},
@var{comp1-node2-time1}, @var{comp2-node2-time1}, @var{comp3-node2-time1},
@var{comp1-node3-time1}, @var{comp2-node3-time1}, @var{comp3-node3-time1},
@var{comp1-node1-time2}, @var{comp2-node1-time2}, @var{comp3-node1-time2},
@var{comp1-node2-time2}, @var{comp2-node2-time2}, @var{comp3-node2-time2},
@var{comp1-node3-time2}, @var{comp2-node3-time2}, @var{comp3-node3-time2},
@dots{}
@end example

For the 2D text objects, the two first @w{@var{expression}s} in
@var{list-of-coords} give the X-Y position of the string in screen
coordinates, measured from the top-left corner of the window. If the first
(respectively second) @var{expression} is negative, the position is measured
from the right (respectively bottom) edge of the window. If the value of the
first (respectively second) @var{expression} is larger than 99999, the
string is centered horizontally (respectively vertically). If the third
@var{expression} is equal to zero, the text is aligned bottom-left and
displayed using the default font and size. Otherwise, the third
@var{expression} is converted into an integer whose eight lower bits give
the font size, whose eight next bits select the font (the index corresponds
to the position in the font menu in the GUI), and whose eight next bits
define the text alignment (0=bottom-left, 1=bottom-center, 2=bottom-right,
3=top-left, 4=top-center, 5=top-right, 6=center-left, 7=center-center,
8=center-right).

For the 3D text objects, the three first @w{@var{expression}s} in
@var{list-of-coords} give the XYZ position of the string in model (real
world) coordinates.  The fourth @var{expression} has the same meaning as the
third @var{expression} in 2D text objects.

For both 2D and 3D text objects, the @var{list-of-values} can contain an
arbitrary number of @w{@var{char-expression}s}.

The optional @code{TIME} list can contain a list of expressions giving the
value of the time (or any other variable) for which an evolution was saved.

The optional @code{INTERPOLATION_SCHEME} lists can contain the
interpolation matrices used for high-order adaptive visualization.

Let us assume that the approximation of the view's value over an element
is written as a linear combination of @var{d} basis functions
@var{f}[@var{i}], @var{i}=0, ..., @var{d}-1 (the coefficients being
stored in @var{list-of-values}). Defining @var{f}[@var{i}] =
Sum(@var{j}=0, ..., @var{d}-1) @var{F}[@var{i}][@var{j}]
@var{p}[@var{j}], with @var{p}[@var{j}] = @var{u}^@var{P}[@var{j}][0]
@var{v}^@var{P}[@var{j}][1] @var{w}^@var{P}[@var{j}][2] (@var{u},
@var{v} and @var{w} being the coordinates in the element's parameter
space), then @var{val-coef-matrix} denotes the @var{d} x @var{d} matrix
@var{F} and @var{val-exp-matrix} denotes the @var{d} x @var{3} matrix
@var{P}.

In the same way, let us also assume that the coordinates @var{x},
@var{y} and @var{z} of the element are obtained through a geometrical
mapping from parameter space as a linear combination of @var{m} basis
functions @var{g}[@var{i}], @var{i}=0, ..., @var{m}-1 (the coefficients
being stored in @var{list-of-coords}). Defining @var{g}[@var{i}] =
Sum(@var{j}=0, ..., @var{m}-1) @var{G}[@var{i}][@var{j}]
@var{q}[@var{j}], with @var{q}[@var{j}] = @var{u}^@var{Q}[@var{j}][0]
@var{v}^@var{Q}[@var{j}][1] @var{w}^@var{Q}[@var{j}][2], then
@var{val-coef-matrix} denotes the @var{m} x @var{m} matrix @var{G} and
@var{val-exp-matrix} denotes the @var{m} x @var{3} matrix @var{Q}.

Here are for example the interpolation matrices for a first order
quadrangle:

@cindex Plugins, post-processing

Post-processing plugins permit to extend the functionality of Gmsh's
post-processing module. The difference between regular post-processing
options (@pxref{Post-processing options list}) and post-processing
plugins is that regular post-processing options only change the way the
data is displayed, while post-processing plugins either create new
post-processing views, or modify the data stored in a view (in a
destructive, non-reversible way).

Plugins are available in the GUI by right-clicking on a view button (or
by clicking on the black arrow next to the view button) and then
selecting the `Plugin' submenu.

Here is the list of the plugins that are shipped by default with Gmsh:

General post-processing option names have the form

views take two forms.

@enumerate
@item options that should apply to all views can be set through
`@code{View.@var{string}}', @emph{before any view is loaded};
@item options that should apply only to the @var{n}-th
view take the form `@code{View[@var{n}].@var{string}}' (@var{n} = 0, 1, 2,
@dots{}), @emph{after the @var{n}-th view is loaded}.
@end enumerate

The list of all post-processing and view options is given in

@cindex File formats

This chapter describes Gmsh's native ``MSH'' file format, used to store
meshes and associated post-processing datasets. The MSH format exists in
two flavors: ASCII and binary. The format has a version number
(currently: 2.1) that is independent of Gmsh's main version number.

(Remember that for small post-processing datasets you can also use
human-readable ``parsed'' post-processing views, as described in
@ref{Post-processing commands}. Such ``parsed'' views do not require an
underlying mesh, and can therefore be easier to use in some
cases.)

@cindex Mesh, file format

@cindex MSH file

The MSH ASCII file format contains one mandatory section giving
information about the file (@code{$MeshFormat}), followed by several
optional sections defining the nodes (@code{$Nodes}), elements
(@code{$Elements}), region names (@code{$PhysicalName}) and
post-processing datasets (@code{$NodeData}, @code{$ElementData},
@code{$ElementNodeData}). 

Any section with an unrecognized header is simply ignored: you can thus
add comments in a @file{.msh} file by putting them e.g. inside a
@code{$Comments}/@code{$EndComments} section.

Sections can be repeated in the same file, and post-processing sections
can be put into separate files (e.g. one file per time step).

The format is defined as follows:

@example
$MeshFormat
@var{version-number} @var{file-type} @var{data-size}
$EndMeshFormat
$Nodes
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}

@end table
See below for the ordering of the nodes.

@item @var{number-of-tags}
gives the number of integer tags that follow for the @var{n}-th
element. By default, the first @var{tag} is the number of the physical
entity to which the element belongs; the second is the number of the
elementary geometrical entity to which the element belongs; the third is
the number of a mesh partition to which the element belongs. All tags
must be postive integers, or zero. A zero tag is equivalent to no tag.

@item @var{node-number-list}
is the list of the node numbers of the @var{n}-th element. The ordering of
the nodes is given in @ref{Node ordering}.

@item @var{number-of-string-tags}
gives the number of string tags that follow. By default the first
@var{string-tag} is interpreted as the name of the post-processing view.
@c todo: and the second as the name of the interpolation scheme?

@item @var{number-of-real-tags}
gives the number of real number tags that follow. By default the first
@var{real-tag} is interpreted as a time value associated with the
dataset.

@item @var{number-of-integer-tags}
gives the number of integer tags that follow. By default the first
@var{integer-tag} is interpreted as a time step index (starting at 0),
the second as the number of field components of the data in the view (1,
3 or 9), the third as the number of entities (nodes or elements) in the
view, and the fourth as the partition index for the view data (0 for no
partition).

@item @var{number-of-nodes-per-elements}
gives the number of node values for an element in an element-based view.

@item @var{value}
is a real number giving the value associated with a node or an
element. For @code{NodeData} (respectively @code{ElementData}) views,
there are @var{ncomp} values per node (resp. per element), where
@var{ncomp} is the number of field components. For
@code{ElementNodeData} views, there are @var{ncomp} times
@var{number-of-nodes-per-elements} values per element.

@item @var{number-of-elements}
has the same meaning as in the ASCII file format.

@item @var{element-header-binary}
is a list of 3 integers in binary form, i.e., an array of (3 * 4) bytes:
the first four bytes contain the type of the elements that follow (same
as @var{elm-type} in the ASCII format), the next four contain the number
of elements that follow, and the last four contain the number of tags
per element (same as @var{number-of-tags} in the ASCII format).

Here is a pseudo C code to write @var{element-header-binary}:
@example
int header[3] = @{elm_type, num_elm_follow, num_tags@};
fwrite(&header, sizeof(int), 3, file);
@end example

@item @var{elements-binary}
is a list of elements in binary form, i.e., an array of ``number of
elements that follow'' * (4 + @var{number-of-tags} * 4 +
#@var{node-number-list} * 4) bytes. For each element, the first four
bytes contain the element number, the next (@var{number-of-tags} * 4)
contain the tags, and the last (#@var{node-number-list} * 4) contain the
node indices.

Here is a pseudo C code to write @var{elements-binary} for triangles
with the 3 standard tags (the physical and elementary regions, and the
mesh partition):
@example
for(i = 0; i < number_of_triangles; i++)@{
  int data[7] = @{num_i, physical, elementary, partition, 
                 node_i_1, node_i_2, node_i_3@};
  fwrite(data, sizeof(int), 7, file);

The nodes of a curved element are numbered in the following order:
@itemize --
@item the element principal vertices;
@item the internal nodes for each edge;
@item the internal nodes for each face;
@item the volume internal nodes.
@end itemize

The numbering for face and volume internal nodes is recursive, i.e., the
numbering follows that of the nodes of an embedded face/volume. The
higher order nodes are assumed to be equispaced on the element.

@subsection MSH file format version 1.0 (Legacy)

The MSH file format version 1.0 is Gmsh's old native mesh file format,
now superseded by the format described in @ref{MSH ASCII file
format}. It is defined as follows:

@example
$NOD
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
@dots{}
$ENDNOD
$ELM
@var{number-of-elements}
@var{elm-number} @var{elm-type} @var{reg-phys} @var{reg-elem} @var{number-of-nodes} @var{node-number-list}
@dots{}
$ENDELM
@end example

@noindent
where
@table @code
@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes in the mesh.

@item @var{node-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th node in the mesh;
@var{node-number} must be a postive (non-zero) integer. Note that the
@w{@var{node-number}s} do not necessarily have to form a dense nor an
ordered sequence.

@item @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
are the floating point values giving the X, Y and Z coordinates of the
@var{n}-th node.

@item @var{number-of-elements}
is the number of elements in the mesh.

@item @var{elm-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th element in the mesh;
@var{elm-number} must be a postive (non-zero) integer. Note that the
@w{@var{elm-number}s} do not necessarily have to form a dense nor an
ordered sequence.

@item @var{elm-type}
defines the geometrical type of the @var{n}-th element:
@table @code
@item 1
2-node line.
@item 2
3-node triangle.
@item 3
4-node quadrangle.
@item 4
4-node tetrahedron.
@item 5
8-node hexahedron.
@item 6
6-node prism.
@item 7
5-node pyramid.
@item 8
3-node second order line (2 nodes associated with the vertices and 1
with the edge).
@item 9
6-node second order triangle (3 nodes associated with the vertices and 3
with the edges).
@item 10
9-node second order quadrangle (4 nodes associated with the vertices, 4
with the edges and 1 with the face).
@item 11
10-node second order tetrahedron (4 nodes associated with the vertices
and 6 with the edges).
@item 12
27-node second order hexahedron (8 nodes associated with the vertices,
12 with the edges, 6 with the faces and 1 with the volume).
@item 13
18-node second order prism (6 nodes associated with the vertices, 9 with
the edges and 3 with the quadrangular faces).
@item 14
14-node second order pyramid (5 nodes associated with the vertices, 8
with the edges and 1 with the quadrangular face).
@item 15
1-node point.
@item 16
8-node second order quadrangle (4 nodes associated with the vertices and
4 with the edges).
@item 17
20-node second order hexahedron (8 nodes associated with the vertices
and 12 with the edges).
@item 18
15-node second order prism (6 nodes associated with the vertices and 9
with the edges).
@item 19
13-node second order pyramid (5 nodes associated with the vertices and 8
with the edges).
@end table
See below for the ordering of the nodes.

@item @var{reg-phys}
is the number of the physical entity to which the element belongs;
@var{reg-phys} must be a postive integer, or zero. If @var{reg-phys} is
equal to zero, the element is considered not to belong to any physical
entity.

@item @var{reg-elem}
is the number of the elementary entity to which the element belongs;
@var{reg-elem} must be a postive (non-zero) integer.

@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes for the @var{n}-th element. This is redundant, but
kept for backward compatibility.

@item @var{node-number-list}
is the list of the @var{number-of-nodes} node numbers of the @var{n}-th
element. The ordering of the nodes is given in @ref{Node ordering}.

where
@table @code
@item @var{file-type}
is an integer equal to 0 in the ASCII file format.

@item @var{data-size}
is an integer equal to the size of the floating point numbers used in the
file (usually, @var{data-size} = sizeof(double)).

@item @var{view-name}
is a string containing the name of the view (max. 256 characters).

@item @var{nb-time-steps}
is an integer giving the number of time steps in the view.

@item @var{nb-scalar-points}
@item @var{nb-vector-points}
@item @dots{}
are integers giving the number of scalar points, vector points, @dots{}, in
the view.

@item @var{nb-text2d}
@item @var{nb-text3d}
are integers giving the number of 2D and 3D text strings in the
view. 

@item @var{nb-text2d-chars}
@item @var{nb-text3d-chars}
are integers giving the total number of characters in the 2D and 3D strings.

@item @var{time-step-values}
is a list of @var{nb-time-steps} double precision numbers giving the value
of the time (or any other variable) for which an evolution was saved.

@item @var{scalar-point-value}
@item @var{vector-point-value}
@item @dots{}
are lists of double precision numbers giving the node coordinates and the
values associated with the nodes of the @var{nb-scalar-points} scalar
points, @var{nb-vector-points} vector points, @dots{}, for each of the
@var{time-step-values}.

For example, @var{vector-triangle-value} is defined as:
@example
@var{coord1-node1} @var{coord1-node2} @var{coord1-node3}
@var{coord2-node1} @var{coord2-node2} @var{coord2-node3}
@var{coord3-node1} @var{coord3-node2} @var{coord3-node3}
@var{comp1-node1-time1} @var{comp2-node1-time1} @var{comp3-node1-time1}
@var{comp1-node2-time1} @var{comp2-node2-time1} @var{comp3-node2-time1}
@var{comp1-node3-time1} @var{comp2-node3-time1} @var{comp3-node3-time1}

The ordering of the nodes is given in @ref{Node ordering}.

@item @var{text2d}
is a list of 4 double precision numbers:
@example
@var{coord1} @var{coord2} @var{style} @var{index}
@end example
where @var{coord1} and @var{coord2} give the X-Y position of the 2D string
in screen coordinates (measured from the top-left corner of the window) and
where @var{index} gives the starting index of the string in
@var{text2d-chars}. If @var{coord1} (respectively @var{coord2}) is negative,
the position is measured from the right (respectively bottom) edge of the
window. If @var{coord1} (respectively @var{coord2}) is larger than 99999,
the string is centered horizontally (respectively vertically).  If
@var{style} is equal to zero, the text is aligned bottom-left and displayed
using the default font and size. Otherwise, @var{style} is converted into an
integer whose eight lower bits give the font size, whose eight next bits
select the font (the index corresponds to the position in the font menu in
the GUI), and whose eight next bits define the text alignment
(0=bottom-left, 1=bottom-center, 2=bottom-right, 3=top-left, 4=top-center,
5=top-right, 6=center-left, 7=center-center, 8=center-right).

@item @var{text2d-chars}
is a list of @var{nb-text2d-chars} characters. Substrings are separated with
the null `@code{\0}' character.

@item @var{text3d}
is a list of 5 double precision numbers
@example
@var{coord1} @var{coord2} @var{coord3} @var{style} @var{index}
@end example
where @var{coord1}, @var{coord2} and @var{coord3} give the XYZ coordinates
of the string in model (real world) coordinates, @var{index} gives the
starting index of the string in @var{text3d-chars}, and @var{style} has the
same meaning as in @var{text2d}.

@item @var{text3d-chars}
is a list of @var{nb-text3d-chars} chars. Substrings are separated with the
null `@code{\0}' character.

@subsection POS binary file format (Legacy)

The POS binary file format is the same as the POS ASCII file format
described in @ref{POS ASCII file format}, except that:

@enumerate
@item
@var{file-type} equals 1.
@item 
all lists of floating point numbers and characters are written in binary
format
@item
there is an additional integer, of value 1, written before
@var{time-step-values}. This integer is used for detecting if the computer
on which the binary file was written and the computer on which the file is
read are of the same type (little or big endian).
@end enumerate

Here is a pseudo C code to write a post-processing file in binary format:

@example
int one = 1;

fprintf(file, "$PostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "%g %d %d\n", 1.4, 1, sizeof(double));
fprintf(file, "$EndPostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "$View\n");

  nb-text2d, nb-text2d-chars, nb-text3d, nb-text3d-chars);
fwrite(&one, sizeof(int), 1, file);
fwrite(time-step-values, sizeof(double), nb-time-steps, file);
fwrite(all-scalar-point-values, sizeof(double), ..., file);
...
fprintf(file, "\n$EndView\n");
@end example
In this pseudo-code, @var{all-scalar-point-values} is the array of double
precision numbers containing all the @var{scalar-point-value} lists, put one
after each other in order to form a long array of doubles. The principle is
the same for all other kinds of values.

@node Source code structure, Coding style, Getting the source, Information for developers
@section Source code structure

Gmsh's code is structured in several libraries, roughly separated
between the three main core modules (@file{Geo}, @file{Mesh},
@file{Post}) and associated utility libraries (@file{Common},
@file{Numeric}) on one hand, and graphics (@file{Graphics}) and
interface (@file{Fltk}, @file{Parser}) libraries on the other.

The geometry and mesh modules are based on an object-oriented model
class (@file{Geo/GModel.h}), built upon abstract geometrical entity
classes (@file{Geo/GVertex.h}, @file{Geo/GEdge.h}, @file{Geo/GFace.h}
and @file{Geo/GRegion.h}). Concrete implementations of the geometrical
entity classes are provided for each supported CAD kernel
(e.g. @file{Geo/gmshVertex.h} for geometry points in Gmsh's native CAD
format, or @file{Geo/OCCVertex.h} for geometry points from
OpenCascade). The post-processing module is based on the concept of
views (@file{Post/PView.h}) and abstract data containers (derived from
@file{Post/PViewData.h}).

please enable full warnings for your compiler (e.g., add @code{-Wall} to
@code{FLAGS} in the @file{variables} file);
@item
always use the @code{Msg::} class to print information, errors, @dots{};

it's a classical option, or in the @code{PViewOptions} class
(@file{Post/PViewOptions.h}) if it's a post-processing view-dependent
option;
@item
in @file{Common/DefaultOptions.h}, give a name (for the parser to be able to
access it), a reference to a handling routine (i.e. @code{opt_XXX}) and a
default value for this option;
@item
create the handling routine @code{opt_XXX} in @file{Common/Options.cpp} (and
add the prototype in @file{Common/Options.h});

@c Compiling with OpenCASCADE
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@c @node Compiling with OpenCASCADE,  , Coding style, Information for developers
@c @section Compiling with OpenCASCADE

@c How to build OpenCascade 6.3 (OCC) for Gmsh:

@c - Get the source distribution of OCC and unpack it (you only need the
@c   "ros" subdirectory). In the following <OpenCascade dir> refers to
@c   the directory where OCC is installed (e.g ~/OpenCASCADE6.3.0)

@c - OS/compiler specific stuff:

@c    * On Windows, use Visual C++ to compile the libraries, or use the
@c      precompiled DLLs directly. (The MinGW compiler used to work with
@c      OCC 6.2 but do not anymore with 6.3.)

@c    * on Mac OS X unfortunately you cannot build universal libs simply
@c      by using "-arch i386 -arch ppc" (the code depends on
@c      configure-time endinanness checks). So, first configure and build
@c      with

@c      export CFLAGS="-arch i386"
@c      export CXXFLAGS="-arch i386" 

@c      and then do "make distclean" and configure and build again
@c      with 
     
@c      export CFLAGS="-arch ppc"
@c      export CXXFLAGS="-arch ppc"

@c      after the install step, use "lipo" to merge both archs, e.g.

@c      lipo -create libi386.a libppc.a -output libuniversal.a

@c - Go to the <OpenCascade dir>/ros directory and type

@c   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/opencascade --enable-debug=no 
@c     --enable-production=yes --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
@c     --disable-dependency-tracking

@c - Then go to the <OpenCascade dir>/ros/adm/make/ directory and
@c   run "make" in the following subdirectories, e.g. by running the
@c   following bash script:

@c     #!/bin/bash
@c     for lib in TKernel TKMath TKAdvTools TKG2d TKG3d TKGeomBase TKBRep 
@c       TKGeomAlgo TKTopAlgo TKPrim TKBO TKHLR TKMesh TKShHealing TKBool 
@c       TKFillet TKFeat TKOffset TKXSBase TKIGES TKSTEPBase TKSTEPAttr 
@c       TKSTEP209 TKSTEP; do
@c         cd $lib && make; cd ..;
@c     done

@c    Note that this is the same as doing "make FoundationClasses", "make
@c    ModelingData", "make ModelingAlgorithms" and part of "make
@c    DataExchange"

@c - Finally, run this other bash script in the same directory (to install
@c   the libraries)

@c     #!/bin/bash
@c     for lib in TKernel TKMath TKAdvTools TKG2d TKG3d TKGeomBase TKBRep 
@c       TKGeomAlgo TKTopAlgo TKPrim TKBO TKHLR TKMesh TKShHealing TKBool 
@c       TKFillet TKFeat TKOffset TKXSBase TKIGES TKSTEPBase TKSTEPAttr 
@c       TKSTEP209 TKSTEP; do
@c         cd $lib && make install; cd ..;
@c     done

@c   and copy config.h and the <OpenCascade dir>/ros/inc/ subdirectory
@c   to /usr/local/opencascade (This is the same as a doing a partial 
@c   'make install')

@c OpenCascade is now installed and ready to be used by Gmsh. To compile
@c Gmsh with OpenCascade support:

@c - Go to the gmsh source directory

@c - Run "./configure --enable-occ --with-occ-prefix=/usr/local/opencascade" and
@c   then "make"

@c - If you get errors like

@c     undefined reference to `pthread_create'
@c     undefined reference to `pthread_detach'
@c     ...

@c   edit the "variables" file and add "-pthread" to the OPTIM variable, e.g.:

@c     OPTIM="-g -O2 -pthread"
   
@c   and run make again

@c - If compiling is successful then you are done and you can enjoy
@c   importing IGES/STEP/BREP files into Gmsh!

Install the `info' version of this reference manual! On your (Unix)
system, this can be achieved by

@enumerate
@item
copying all @file{gmsh.info*} files to the place where your info files live
(usually @file{/usr/info}), and
@item
issuing the command @code{install-info /usr/info/gmsh.info /usr/info/dir}.
@end enumerate

You will then be able to access the documentation with the command
@code{info gmsh}. Note that particular sections (`nodes') can be accessed
directly. For example, @code{info gmsh surfaces} or @code{info gmsh surf}
will take you directly to @ref{Surfaces}.
@item
Use emacs to edit your files, and load the C++ mode. This permits automatic
syntax highlighting and easy indentation. Automatic loading of the C++ mode
for @file{.geo} files can be achieved by adding the following command in
your @code{.emacs} file: @code{(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.geo$"
. c++-mode)) auto-mode-alist))}.
@item
Define common geometrical objects and options in separate files, reusable in
all your problem definition structures.
@item
Save your preferred options with `File->Save Default Options'. To reset
the default options, erase the @code{General.OptionsFileName} (usually
@file{.gmsh-options} in your home directory) or use the `Restore default
