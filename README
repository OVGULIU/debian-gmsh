This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities.

To install Gmsh, type

./configure
make
make install

This requires GSL 1.2 or higher (freely available from
http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/) and FLTK 1.1.x (configured with OpenGL
support; freely available from http://www.fltk.org). You can use the
--with-fltk-prefix and --with-gsl-prefix configure options (or define
the FLTK_PREFIX and GSL_PREFIX environment variables) if the libraries
are not installed in their default locations.

To install a non-graphical version of Gmsh (that does not require FLTK
nor OpenGL), type

./configure --disable-gui
make
make install

For a description of all other configuration options, type

./configure --help
